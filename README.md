Machine Structures
Language: C, MIPS

digitrec_C: Compares two images, one of a modified image of a number and one of a standard number. Finds the closest match
            to a number and returns it. Written in C.

digitrec_MIPS: Compares two images, one of a modified image of a number and one of a standard number. Finds the closest match
                to a number and returns it. Written in MIPS.
                
mapreduce: Mapreduce on min and max tree of a simple connect 4 game by looking at the most ideal moves for each player. This
           way I know the winner at each given state of the game.
           
parallelization: Parallelizes the digitrec code so it will work for large image templates. Utilizes many optimizations such
                 as OpenMP, SSE instructions, and loop unrolling.

optimization_GPU: Parallelizes the digitrec code so it will work for large image templates. Utilizes GPU and CUDA 
                  optimizations.
                  
processor_design: Logisim creation of the single cycle datapath for IDA assembly language.
