PROJECT 4 WRITE-UP
------------------

1) Briefly explain how you implemented comparison queries and how they affected your control block's signals (in a few sentences).

If I am doing a comparison in ALU, then I would send the 8 bits corresponding to the 8 different comparisons to the comparison control. Depending on the comparison request, I would select from the 8 bits and return true or false. 

2) Please list your control block's control signals, and briefly explain what each one does (in a sentence or less each).

jump?: jump inst. if this is on.
link?: link inst. if this is on.
reg write?: write back to registers if this is on.
memwrite?: write to memory if this is on.
load?: load from memory if this is on.
comp?: comparison inst. if this is on.

3) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you like?

I liked the fact that there werenâ€™t any branch instructions and we just needed the comparison values to determine it. Makes it easy to put everything together.

4) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you not like?

None. Self explanatory and easy language to implement.
