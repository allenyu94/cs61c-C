	sans_serif_5.bmp is not recognized correctly. Should be 5 but output was 6.
	serif_8.bmp is not recognized correctly. Should be 8 but output was 3. 
	serif_5.bmp is not recognized corretly. Should be 5 but output was 1. 

2. For each test image listed in the previous question, What is the difference in "digit distances" between the recognized digit and the digit it is supposed to be (e.g. if a digit 3 is recognized as 8, and 3 has a "digit distance" of 10 while 8 has a "digit distance" of 20, then difference in distances is 20 - 10 = 10).

	sans_serif_5.bmp: 8969982
	serif_8.bmp: 4860691
	serif_5.bmp: 9669362

3. Give a one to two sentence explanation on why you think the images mentioned above are recognized incorrectly.

	Because of the font difference, the positioning and form of the number value impacts the digit difference significantly.
